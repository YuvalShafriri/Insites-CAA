# InSites: Significance Assessment through the Looking Glass of Gen-AI

**CAA 2026 Vienna Workshop | March 30, 2026**

A hands-on workshop exploring Human–AI collaboration for heritage significance assessment. Using our InSites agentic workflow, participants will experiment with transforming site documentation into structured assessments—detecting contexts, identifying values, and drafting explainable significance statements.

📅 **Workshop resources and the InSites tool will be shared closer to the event date.**
