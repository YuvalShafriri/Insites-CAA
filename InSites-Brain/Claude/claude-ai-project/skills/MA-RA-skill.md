# [MA-RA] Read-Assessment: Single Assessment Analysis

**Purpose**: Analyze a completed significance assessment — whether produced in the current conversation, uploaded as a document, or pasted as text — and offer structured insights and interactive representations. This is a *reading* workflow, not a *writing* workflow: it does not produce new assessment stages, but rather examines what has already been written.

**Relationship to other workflows**:
- **Write (Stages 0–6)** produces the assessment. **MA-RA** reads it.
- **MA-RC (Read-Collection)** analyzes multiple assessments. **MA-RA** analyzes one.
- KG, Timeline, Dashboard are tools that MA-RA can invoke — available *through* it, not separate from it.

---

## Activation

**Explicit triggers**: "read assessment", "analyze assessment", "review assessment"

**Implicit activation**: If the user uploads a text that contains recognizable CBSA stage outputs (value lists, Nara Grid, significance statement, etc.) without requesting "start" or "begin assessment", confirm briefly:

> "This looks like a completed assessment. Would you like me to analyze it (Read mode), or use it as input for a new assessment (Write mode)?"

**Post-Write activation**: If the user has just completed Stage 6 and says "now analyze what we wrote", "let's look at this", or "read assessment" — switch to MA-RA using the conversation's own stage outputs. No upload needed.

---

## Step 1 — Assessment Profile

Parse the assessment and produce a compact diagnostic. No greeting, no preamble.

**1a. Coverage Scan**

| CBSA Element | Present? | Depth | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Site description | ✓/— | thin / adequate / rich | |
| Timeline | ✓/— | N events | |
| Contexts | ✓/— | N identified | |
| Values | ✓/— | N identified | |
| Authenticity / Integrity | ✓/— | Nara Grid? | |
| Comparative analysis | ✓/— | N comparators | |
| Significance statement | ✓/— | word count | |

**1b. Quick Observations** (3–5 sentences)

Describe the assessment's character — not quality judgment, but profile:
- Which CBSA dimensions are well-developed vs. thin
- Whether evidence citations are present and traceable
- Any notable emphasis, imbalance, or gap
- Assessment language: professional / academic / informal / mixed

**1c. Source Inventory** (if identifiable)

List the sources the assessment draws on: `[filename/reference] — scope note`.

---

## Step 2 — Reading Menu

**Framework principle**: A "reading" is any structured way of examining the assessment to surface insights that aren't visible on first encounter. Readings range from analytical (data-driven) to interpretive (perspective-driven) to generative (creative). The list below is open — the user can propose any reading they wish.

Present available readings using this format:

> **How would you like to read this assessment?**
>
> **Analytical readings** — structured, evidence-based:
> - **Knowledge Graph** — interactive map of entities and relationships
> - **Evidence Weight** — which claims are well-supported vs. thinly grounded
> - **Gap & Strength** — what's solid, what needs work
> - **Source-Assessment Fidelity** — how faithfully the assessment represents its source material
> - **Context-Effect Audit** — trace bidirectional context↔value influences through the assessment
> - **Timeline** — if dated events exist
>
> **Interpretive readings** — perspective-driven:
> - **Stakeholder Lens** — how different decision-makers would read this
> - **[Other lenses — see examples below]**
>
> **Your own reading** — propose any angle, question, or lens
>
> Choose one or more, or suggest your own.

**Rules**:
- Do NOT auto-generate any reading. Wait for user selection.
- If the assessment lacks the data for a selected reading, say so and suggest an alternative.
- Multiple selections: execute sequentially, with brief transition between each.
- If the user proposes a reading the bot hasn't seen before, accept it and construct a response grounded in the assessment text.

## Interpretive Reading Framework

Interpretive readings apply a *lens* — a perspective, persona, or provocative question — to the assessment. The lens does not change the data; it changes what you notice.

**Architecture of a lens**:
1. **Name** — evocative, memorable
2. **Perspective** — who is looking, or what question drives the reading
3. **What it surfaces** — the kind of insight this lens tends to reveal
4. **Output** — 3–5 focused observations, grounded in the assessment text

**Three built-in examples** (demonstrating the range):

---

### Example A — "The Stakeholder Table"

**Perspective**: Heritage decision-makers with competing interests — manager, developer, community, researcher, educator.

**What it surfaces**: How the same assessment serves (or fails) different practical needs. Which values matter to whom. What's missing from each actor's standpoint.

**Output**: For each stakeholder (4–5), write 3–4 sentences:
- What in this assessment is most relevant to their concerns
- What is missing from their perspective
- What tension or risk they would flag

**Closing**: "Any stakeholder you'd like to explore further, or one that's missing?"

**Why this works**: Turns the assessment from a static document into a negotiation tool. Shows that significance assessment is not "the answer" but "one expert input" into a decision process.

---

### Example B — "The Court Jester" (ליצן החצר)

**Perspective**: A deliberately provocative reader who questions what the assessment takes for granted. Not hostile — playful but sharp.

**What it surfaces**: Assumptions, blind spots, narratives that were accepted without challenge, values that might be projections rather than evidence-based.

**Output**: 3–5 pointed observations, each structured as:
- **"The assessment assumes that..."** — identify an unstated assumption
- **"But what if..."** — offer a counter-reading grounded in the same evidence
- Keep tone constructive-provocative, not dismissive

**Closing**: "Which of these provocations resonates? Want to dig into one?"

**Why this works**: Heritage assessments tend toward consensus and authority. A "jester" reading reveals where the assessment is strong enough to withstand challenge — and where it isn't.

---

### Example C — "The Muse" (המוזה)

**Perspective**: A reader attuned to the aesthetic, narrative, and emotional dimensions — what makes this place *evocative*, not just significant.

**What it surfaces**: Moments in the assessment where the writing comes alive (or falls flat). Narrative potential that the CBSA structure may have compressed. Sensory and experiential dimensions that are implied but not developed.

**Output**: 3–5 observations:
- **"The story here is..."** — identify the strongest narrative thread
- **"What's felt but not said..."** — an experiential dimension that the assessment hints at
- **"If this were told to..."** — how the assessment might be reframed for a specific audience (visitors, children, artists, filmmakers)

**Closing**: "Would you like to develop one of these narrative directions?"

**Why this works**: CBSA is an analytical framework. The Muse reading reconnects it to the reason people care about heritage in the first place — experience, meaning, wonder.

---

### User-Proposed Readings

When a user proposes their own lens, the bot:
1. Asks a brief clarifying question if the lens is ambiguous ("What kind of insight are you looking for?")
2. Constructs the reading using the same architecture: perspective → what it surfaces → 3–5 grounded observations → closing prompt
3. Names the lens (with the user's input) so it can be referenced later

---

## Analytical Reading Specifications

### Knowledge Graph

Execute the KG skill as specified. Data extracted from the uploaded/pasted assessment, not from stage outputs in the current conversation.

**Adaptation**: If the assessment doesn't follow CBSA stage structure, extract entities and relationships from the narrative directly. Same node priority order (value-bearing entities → places/events → context anchors → actors → up to 3 value nodes).

---

### Evidence Weight

**Purpose**: Show which parts of the assessment rest on solid evidential ground and which are thinly supported.

**Process**:
1. Identify all value claims and significance assertions in the assessment
2. For each, assess evidential backing:
   - **Well-grounded** (●) — multiple explicit evidence links, traceable citations
   - **Supported** (◐) — some evidence, but limited or indirect
   - **Asserted** (○) — stated without clear evidence, or evidence is vague/generic
3. Present as annotated summary — NOT a ranking of "importance"

**Output format**:

```
📋 Evidence Weight — [Asset Name]

● Well-grounded:
  - Historical value: anchored in 3 dated sources + physical evidence [A:3, A:7, B:2]
  - Architectural value: detailed fabric description with measurements [A:4-5]

◐ Supported:
  - Social value: community use mentioned, but sourced from single interview [B:12]
  - Technological value: construction methods noted, period attribution uncertain°

○ Asserted:
  - Landscape value: "contributes to the visual character of the area" — no specific description of what or how
  - Symbolic value: claimed but not linked to any evidence passage
```

**Critical constraint**: This reading describes the *text's* evidential structure. It does NOT judge whether the values themselves are "more or less important." A well-grounded value is not necessarily more significant than an asserted one — it is simply better documented in this assessment.

**Follow-up offer**: "Would you like to focus on strengthening one of the thinly supported areas?"

---

### Source-Assessment Fidelity

**Purpose**: Examine how faithfully the assessment represents its source material — where claims track the sources closely vs. where interpretation has drifted or data has been over-extrapolated.

**Process**:
1. Compare assessment claims against cited source passages
2. Classify each significant claim: **faithful** (directly supported), **interpreted** (reasonable inference), **stretched** (claim goes beyond what sources say)
3. Note any source material that the assessment ignores or underuses

**Output**: Table of key claims with fidelity rating and source reference. 3–5 sentence summary of overall fidelity pattern.

---

### Context-Effect Audit

**Purpose**: Trace the bidirectional context↔value influences through the assessment to see if context effects are explicitly articulated or left implicit.

**Process**:
1. For each identified context, trace: which values does it generate or shape?
2. For each identified value, trace: how does it reflect back on or transform its contexts?
3. Identify context-effect pairs that are well-articulated vs. assumed

**Output**: Context-effect map (table or diagram) showing the bidirectional flows. Flag pairs where only one direction is articulated. 3–5 sentence summary.

---

### Gap & Strength Analysis

**Output structure**:

**Strengths** (2–3 points) — What the assessment does well. Cite specific sections.

**Gaps** (2–4 points) — What's missing or underdeveloped. Be specific:
- Not "values section is weak" but "Social value is claimed but supported by only one anecdotal reference; no community consultation data is cited"

**Quick Boosts** (up to 3 rows):

| Gap | Small improvement that would make a difference |
| --- | --- |
| [specific gap] | [concrete action] |

**Note**: If the user has already seen Stage 6 output, acknowledge overlap and focus on anything additional a fresh read reveals.

---

### Timeline

If the assessment contains ≥3 dated events, generate Timeline artifact.
If <3: "The assessment mentions only [N] dated events. Would you like me to flag where date information is missing?"

---

## UX Flow

**Step 1** (Assessment Profile) → **Step 2** (Reading Menu) → **Execute** selected reading(s), each with follow-up offer → **Loop**: "Another reading, or done?"

**Closing**: Every MA-RA interaction ends with:
```
Another reading? | Switch to Write mode? | Done?
─────
📖 Read-Assessment
```

---

## Style Guardrails

- **Diagnostic, not judgmental**. The profile describes; it does not grade.
- **Assessment-first, source-informed**. All observations cite the assessment text. No external knowledge injected unless user requests it.
- **Concise**. Profile (Step 1) fits one screen. Each reading ≤400 words unless user asks more.
- **No CBSA stage mixing**. MA-RA does not produce new stage outputs. If the user wants to *improve* the assessment, suggest switching to Write mode for the relevant stage.
- **Open framework**. The reading menu is not exhaustive. Always include "Your own reading" as an option. Accept and execute any reasonable user-proposed lens.
