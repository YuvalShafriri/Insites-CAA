## Description

Articulating significance, which is crucial in value-based heritage management, is a complex interpretive task requiring the synthesis of diverse and fragmented evidence. While Gen-AI offers powerful processing capabilities, delegating this creative process to a machine raises critical ethical concerns.

In this workshop, inspired by Lewis Carroll's novel *Through the Looking Glass*, we navigate this tension by positioning Gen-AI as a reflective partner. Using our InSites Human–AI agentic workflow, we will examine how transformer-based models complement Context-Based Significance Assessment (CBSA), as both fundamentally rely on deep contextual understanding. We move beyond the hype to ask: *Can Gen-AI transparently read and analyze the site documentation so humans can better "read the site" and conserve it?*

We will experiment with transforming site information (from excavation reports, etc.) into a structured assessment process, guiding the users through "mini agents" steps in the InSites tool. We'll move from detecting missing information and identifying contexts and values to drafting explainable significance statements. Beyond writing, we will experiment with multivocal narratives, knowledge graphs, and interactive views, ranging from standard timelines to novel participant-invented visualizations, that help to gain new cultural insights and communicate them in new ways. An optional AI-training mode will add guidance for learning purposes.

The InSites workflow is grounded in three core Human–AI design principles: methodological alignment (embedding professional protocols), cognitive transparency and strict evidence grounding, which we will explore throughout the workshop sessions.

## Workshop Program

### 1. Theory & Demo
An introduction on the CBSA methodology embedded in the system and how transformer models "mirror" it, followed by a live InSites demo.

### 2. Hands-On Main Sessions

- **Write with InSites:** Co-authoring a significance assessment for a site of the participants' choice alongside the agent workflow, including the generation of visual artifacts and interactive dashboards.
- **Read with InSites:** Analyzing the generated assessments to detect hidden patterns.

### 3. Ethics in Practice
Participants will apply our design principles to experiment with creating a custom agent for their specific needs.

---

## Workshop Takeaways

- A preliminary significance assessment report of the site and other generated artifacts.
- Hands-on experimentation with structured Human-AI collaboration workflows.
- Continued access to the InSites tool, website, and GitHub repository.
